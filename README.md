# nextjsapp

## Exercise: Create a Next.js application that displays a list of products. Each product should have a name, price, and image. Users should be able to filter the list of products by category.

## Requirements:

* Use Next.js and React to create the application.
* Use a data source to populate the list of products. This can be a local JSON file, a database, or an API.
* Implement a filter that allows users to filter the list of products by category.
* Use static site generation (SSG) to generate the list of products. This will improve the performance of the application.

## Bonus:

* Add the ability to add and remove products from the list.
* Add the ability to search for products by name.
* Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for the product details page.
* Style the application using CSS.
